# Roleplay-Aligned Validation Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the results of the roleplay-aligned validation testing performed on the UP AI Agent (Assistant ID: 0186f1fa-ded1-45ff-a7cf-20d7807ac429) to address the "Biraz dağıldık sanki" (we got a bit distracted) issue.

## Problem Statement
The AI agent was consistently responding with "Biraz dağıldık sanki" when asked direct banking questions, indicating it expected roleplay context rather than factual queries. This suggested the agent was designed for sales coaching roleplay scenarios.

## Solution Approach
Created a roleplay-aligned validation script that:
1. Establishes roleplay context first (setup message)
2. Asks banking questions as a customer within the roleplay
3. Evaluates responses for both roleplay maintenance and banking accuracy

## Key Technical Fix
**Request Format Issue**: Fixed critical 500 Internal Server Error by changing request body parameter from `message` to `query` to match the working validation script format.

## Key Findings

### Successes
- **Fixed 500 errors**: Request format correction resolved server communication issues
- **Roleplay context maintained**: Agent successfully stays in character across scenarios
- **Turkish language support**: All responses are in Turkish with proper banking terminology
- **Improved response quality**: Better than direct questioning approach

### Challenges
- **Inconsistent banking accuracy**: Varies from 30% to 70% across scenarios
- **Context drift**: Still some instances of "Biraz dağıldık sanki" even with roleplay setup
- **Keyword coverage**: Generally low (0-33%) indicating incomplete banking information

## Comparison with Previous Validation

### Direct Questioning (interactiveConversationalValidation.js)
- Consistent failure with "Biraz dağıldık sanki" responses
- 53.7% average conversation score
- Poor roleplay alignment

### Roleplay-Aligned Approach
- Mixed but improved results (4-7/10 scores)
- Maintained roleplay context
- Better banking information provision
- Still some context confusion

## Technical Implementation

### Request Format
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
  query: message,        // Fixed: was 'message'
  assistantId,
  stage: CONFIG.stage,
}),
```

### Roleplay Scenario Structure
```javascript
{
  setup: "Context establishment message",
  customerQuestion: "Banking question as customer",
  expectedBankingInfo: "Reference answer",
  validationKeywords: ["key", "terms", "to", "validate"],
  roleplayContext: "scenario_type",
  testType: "validation_category"
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Roleplay Context**: Refine setup messages to better align with agent's training
2. **Improve Banking Accuracy**: Focus on keyword coverage improvement
3. **Context Stability**: Address remaining instances of context drift
4. **Complete Testing**: Run full 5-scenario validation to completion
5. **Compare Approaches**: Generate comparative analysis with direct questioning results
