   - Implement document update/refresh mechanism for agent changes

2. **Query Processing System:**
   - Accept user text queries as input
   - Generate embeddings for user queries using same model as agent documents
   - Perform similarity search against agent document collection
   - Return top 3 most relevant agents with similarity scores

3. **Response Format:**
   - Return agent ID, name, description, and relevance score
   - Include similarity threshold filtering (minimum relevance score)
   - Provide fallback mechanism when no agents meet threshold
   - Support both Turkish and English query processing

4. **API Endpoint Implementation:**
   - Create REST endpoint: `POST /api/agents/recommend`
   - Accept JSON payload: `{"query": "user text query"}`
   - Return structured response with top 3 agent recommendations
